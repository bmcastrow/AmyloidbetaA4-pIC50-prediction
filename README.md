# üß† Amyloid-beta A4 potency Prediction

## Context

Alzheimer's disease is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative disorders, affecting millions worldwide. 
A key hallmark of Alzheimer's pathology is the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain, which are thought to disrupt cell function, leading to cognitive decline and dementia. 

üíä Developing therapies to inhibit the aggregation of amyloid-beta or reduce its production has been a major focus of Alzheimer's research. In this project, the aim is to predict the inhibitory concentration (pIC50) of chemical compounds against Amyloid-beta A4, using both traditional machine learning and GenAI technology. By  predicting pIC50 values, the hope is to identify chemical compounds that could potentially inhibit the production or aggregation of amyloid-beta, providing a valuable starting point for therapeutic development.

## Project overview

üìú Data: Exploration of the ChEMBL database, including the calculation of chemical descriptors using RDKit (Lipinski descriptors), the generation of molecular fingerprints with PaDEL-Descriptor, as well as preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

üî¨ ML Pipeline: A machine learning workflow leveraging molecular fingerprints as input features, with tree-based regressors optimized using Optuna üßø for efficient hyperparameter tuning and performance enhancement.

ü§ñ DL Pipeline: Deep learning method Using Hugging Face's ChemBERTa on SMILES combined with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for cost-effective fine-tuning with an adaptation for regression purposes (Loading...‚åõ‚ö†Ô∏è) 

üîÑ MLflow Integration: Experiments are tracked using MLFlow, in order to track model performance and hyperparameter trials that are optimzed using Bayesian optimization (Optuna for the ML Pipeline).
